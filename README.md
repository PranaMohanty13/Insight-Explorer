# Insight-Explorer

Insight Explorer is an interactive AI-powered dashboard designed for non-technical users. The application empowers non-technical users to effortlessly analyze call campaign performance using an intuitive time-series graph. Users can highlight or circle specific anomalies on the graph and click the "Investigate" button. This action triggers a backend process that retrieves relevant data—such as call transcripts and campaign descriptions—and then leverages the DeepSeek API to generate a comprehensive report explaining the changes. The report provides actionable insights, key quotes, and recommendations, enabling users to understand the reasons behind performance shifts and make informed decisions.
